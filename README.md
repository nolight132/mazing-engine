# MazingEngine ðŸš€

MazingEngine is an **ongoing** project aimed at creating a terminal-based 3D maze visualization program using [AABBs](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bounding_volume) and raycasting.
It will generate random mazes and render them in a first-person perspective using ASCII characters.

## ðŸš§ This project is still in its early stages, most of the work is done in ```dev-renderer``` branch.

## Features

-   [x] **Procedurally Generated Maze**
    -   [x] Implement random maze generation
-   [x] **Frame Rate Control**
    -   [x] Implement FPS control for smooth rendering
-   [ ] **Raycasting for 3D-like Rendering**
    -   [x] Implement raycasting algorithm
    -   [ ] Implement wall rendering
-   [ ] **Camera Movement**
    -   [ ] Add controls for moving the camera in the maze
    -   [ ] Implement first-person perspective
